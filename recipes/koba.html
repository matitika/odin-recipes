    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Today we introduce a unique dessert from Madagascar called "Koba". It's a delight that displays the delicious foods on the island. Ripe bananas, peanuts, and rice flour combine to form a delicious traditional Malagasy treat. It occasionally also contains coconut for creaminess and vanilla for scent. Koba informs us about the inventive cuisine of Madagascar and how they enjoy preparing tasty meals using ingredients found nearby.</p>
