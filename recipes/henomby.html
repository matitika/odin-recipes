    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Simple cooking rends beef tender and the ginger gives it a very different flavor from the characteristic Western cuisine. The name for a stewed beef dish in Madagascar is hen'omby. This ginger stewed beef recipe is to be enjoyed with a good amount of boiled rice, a small bowl of rougai the really spicy sauce typical in the Indic Ocean area, and a few of the pickled vegetables known as achards, preferably tomatoes and onions.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons canola oil
        <li>2 pounds beef roast, cut in cubes</li>
        <li>2-inch piece fresh ginger, sliced</li>
        <li>2 roma tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper</li>
        <li>3-4 cups water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch + Â¼ cup cold water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a dutch oven over medium high-heat.  Add beef (working in batches) and sear on all sides.</li>
        <li>Once all beef is seared, return it all to the pot.  Add the ginger, tomatoes, and garlic.  Season with salt & pepper and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add enough water to cover the beef.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook for 2 hours, checking occasionally to make sure there is still enough water.</li>
        <li>After 2 hours, remove the cover and turn the heat to medium.  Whisk together the cornstarch and water, then whisk the cornstarch mixture into the cooking liquid.  Cook until the liquid is thickened and reduced, another 30-45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice.</li>
