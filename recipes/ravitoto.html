    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ravitoto is a high-fat dish in which the amount of oil and the quality of the meat are crucial.
        This dish is typically served with pork meat or Henakisoa in Malagasy, but if you do not eat pork, other meats such as beef or chicken can be substituted.

        According to some historians, in the recipe for Ravitoto and Henakisoa (pork), only garlic and especially oil are used, rather than ginger or shallots.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g pounded cassava leaves (available from Afro/Asian traders, e.g. in the freezer section);</li>
        <li>1-litre sunflower oil (or 50 cl for those who prefer to avoid excess fat);</li> 
        <li>1/2 clove garlic; </li>
        <li>ginger</li>
        <li>800 g of the fattest pork belly (preferably with bone)</li>
        <li>1 shallot</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the meat into large cubes and saut√© in oil until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Brown the sliced shallot in a little oil in a pot (cast iron type), then add the garlic and cassava leaves. Mix thoroughly, then add the ginger (just for flavour) and the oil, at least half of the bottle for those who are afraid of fat.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, over low heat.</li>
        <li>When the cassava leaves have completely changed colour, it is ready (from green to almost black)</li>
    </ol>
